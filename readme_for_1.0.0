# AMebius-slicer
AM slicer can generate gcode from STL file, you can define printer parameters, and some print settings<br>
However, this is only a basic version, filling path planing still in low efficiency.<br>
The slicer has passed the actual printing test.<br>
Please use Cura to preview slice result before real print<br>

# Usage
Run main.m, modify filenam gfilename

# Require
Matlab R2017b

Major update
Major improvements for the overall framework
AMebius Slice now generate the solid layer properly
AMebius Slice now can gennerate support(silly, maybe we can add some areas diff to improve)
Auto detect STL file type
Multiple adaptive slice decision algorithm
New Fast External Adaptive methods, refer to this paper:
Konwing issue:
Some thin-shell model may slice improperly
Some rapidly changing cross section cant generate support(e.g. shape Y is OK, T is dump)
